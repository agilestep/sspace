    <h1> Why Ruby on Rails in 2023</h1>
    <p>
      Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source web framework that has been
      around since 2004. While some may argue that it has lost its shine and
      popularity over the years, Ruby on Rails is still a good choice for web
      development in 2023. Here are my arguments below:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Rapid Development</strong>: Ruby on Rails is known for its
        ability to quickly develop web applications. Its "convention over
        configuration" philosophy enables developers to build web applications
        faster by using pre-built components, libraries, and tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mature Ecosystem</strong>: Ruby on Rails has a mature ecosystem
        with a vast collection of libraries and plugins that make web development
        more accessible and efficient. The community-driven development of Ruby on
        Rails has led to the creation of a large number of gems (libraries) that can
        be easily integrated into the application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scalability</strong>: Scalability is a critical factor in modern web
        development, and Ruby on Rails is designed to be scalable. The framework is
        built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the
        concerns of the application and makes it easier to scale. Additionally,
        Ruby on Rails applications can be easily deployed on cloud platforms like
        Heroku and AWS, which provides the ability to scale the application as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stability and Security</strong>: Ruby on Rails has been around for
        over a decade, and it has become more stable and secure over time. The Rails
        community is dedicated to ensuring the security and reliability of the
        framework, and regular updates are released to address security
        vulnerabilities and bugs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Ruby on Rails is an open-source framework,
        and there are no licensing fees or subscription costs associated with it.
        This makes it an ideal choice for startups and small businesses that have
        limited budgets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community Support</strong>: The Ruby on Rails community is one of
        the most vibrant and active developer communities. There are many online
        resources, forums, and communities dedicated to supporting Ruby on Rails
        developers. This means that developers can get help with their projects and
        quickly find solutions to problems that they encounter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>At the End:</strong>: Look at this: <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commits/main"> Rails GitHub</a> <strong> YES</strong> work in progress :)
        Great day to you my friend!
